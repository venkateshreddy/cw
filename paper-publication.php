        <p>We are going to support you in writing a research paper which helps you to publish a paper to top tire journals which helps you to build your career faster </p>
        
        <h3>Steps that need to be taken care for  your Journal:</h3>
        <p>Preparing  a high-quality research paper that get approval from trusted and top tire journals like IEEE Transaction, Elsevier and Springer publication is a complicated task. As these journals track a strict screening process and need a obvious and significant contribution and a research flavor.</p>
        <p>Most of the students/scholars  usually do a fantastic work during their academic projects but due to lack of understanding and guidance of writing a good research paper make their efforts go unrecognized and appreciated by the research and academic communities.</p>
        <p>There are ten  basic elements of a research paper. They are Title, Abstract, Table of Contents/ Abstract graphics(A scheme or figure to convey the theme of paper), Overview and problem statement, Literature survey, Proposed method, Experimental data analysis and results, Conclusion and References. A good research paper is a combination of these sections, where every section is written as best as it should be.</p>

      <div class="panel-heading"><h3>Title</h3></div>
      <ul class="list-group">
        <li class="list-group-item">Compose a title that is simple, attractive and accurately reflects the investigation </li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Phrases to avoid: Investigation, Study, Novel, Facile etc.</li>
        <li class="list-group-item">Avoid Acronyms that are known only to specialized community</li>                 
      </ul>
    </div>

  <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> it gives concise information about the paper. Usually it consist of six to seven short sentences and it needs be with in of 150~200 words. First couple of sentences should focus on what the study is about  A good Abstract includes a statement about problem, proposed solution, and a statement about the datasets and results. A final statement that addresses the contribution of the paper to the relevant field of research. Make this very simple precise and understandable, as readers will decided to read complete paper or not after reading Abstract.
-Be creative in generating curiosity
</p>
<p><strong>Table of Contents/ Abstract graphics:</strong> A scheme or figure to convey the theme of paper. A graphic must be included with each manuscript(a book, document, or piece of music written by hand rather than typed or printed.) for display in the table of contents (TOC) and the abstract. This graphic should capture the reader’s attention and, in conjunction with the manuscript title, should give the reader a quick visual impression of the essence of the manuscript without providing specific results. </p>

<p><strong>Overview and Problem Statement: </strong>This section consists of several paragraphs. This section addresses the problem domain (field or area), its importance and applications. Solving an important problem with good application will usually lead to a good paper. The best practice is to make this section simple clear and easy to understand. If possible try to add references each statement addressing the importance and application.</p>
<p><strong>Literature survey:</strong> This section contains information about the existing methods available to solve the same problem or related problems. A good literature survey usually contains a comprehensive and exhaustive list of methods used in past, their advantages and disadvantages and their applications.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed Method:</strong> This section and results are heart of the paper. Every minute detail about the proposed method need be explained in this section. It is better to writ this section considering that you are writing it for a person who doesn’t know anything about the field and you need to explain him the solution.</p>
<p><strong>Experimental data analysis and results:</strong> This section contains information about experimental data generation or collection and its properties. Application of data to proposed and other existing methods and a deep analysis of result and their validation make this as an ideal section.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong> A good conclusion to the paper usually contain two to three paragraphs mentioning the superior properties of the proposed solution compared to existing methods and state its significance in the field with useful applications.</p>
<p><strong>References:</strong> these research papers published in journals or conferences and relevant to the research work being written for the publications. Make sure that the format given by the journal is followed for all references and all of them are cited in the paper.</p>
